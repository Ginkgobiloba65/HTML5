FONTS
 Google offers Google Fonts, a directory of thousands of open-source fonts that are free to use by anyone.
 es. <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" > 
 where Roboto is the font and 100 specifies an optional font weight for Roboto

1 The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visit the web page. 
We'll learn how to work around this issue in a later exercise.

2 It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3.

3 When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, 
it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized), like so:
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}

Serif vs Sans-Serif
The practice of typography has been around for centuries! 
Over time, typographers have refined their craft and have developed many different typefaces, 
which has allowed them, in some cases, to classify them as one of the following two types: 
serif fonts and sans-serif fonts.

Serif - the letters in these fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. 
Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.
Sans-Serif - the letters in these fonts do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. 
Instead, letters have straight, flat edges. Some examples include Arial or Helvetica.

h1 {
  font-family: Garamond, Times, serif;
}
The CSS rule above says: "Use the Garamond font for all <h1> elements on the web page. 
If that font is not available, use the Times font. 
If both of those fonts are not available, use any serif font pre-installed on the user's computer."
