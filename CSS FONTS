FONTS

1 The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visit the web page. 
We'll learn how to work around this issue in a later exercise.

2 It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3.

3 When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, 
it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized), like so:
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}
