FONTS
 Google offers Google Fonts, a directory of thousands of open-source fonts that are free to use by anyone.
 es. <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" > 
 where Roboto is the font and 100 specifies an optional font weight for Roboto 
 Font weights can be set to 100 (thin), 200, 300, 400 (normal weight), 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900 (bold).

1 The font specified in a stylesheet must be installed on a user's computer in order for that font to display when a user visit the web page. 
We'll learn how to work around this issue in a later exercise.

2 It's a good practice to limit the number of typefaces used on a web page to 2 or 3.

3 When the name of a typeface consists of more than one word, 
it must be enclosed in double quotes (otherwise it will not be recognized), like so:
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New";
}

Serif vs Sans-Serif
The practice of typography has been around for centuries! 
Over time, typographers have refined their craft and have developed many different typefaces, 
which has allowed them, in some cases, to classify them as one of the following two types: 
serif fonts and sans-serif fonts.

Serif - the letters in these fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter. 
Examples include fonts like Times New Roman or Georgia, among others.
Sans-Serif - the letters in these fonts do not have extra details on the ends of each letter. 
Instead, letters have straight, flat edges. Some examples include Arial or Helvetica.

h1 {
  font-family: Garamond, Times, serif;
}
The CSS rule above says: "Use the Garamond font for all <h1> elements on the web page. 
If that font is not available, use the Times font. 
If both of those fonts are not available, use any serif font pre-installed on the user's computer."



Font Size II
There are three units of measurement for font size:

1. px - Represents the unit of pixels. The display of a computer monitor can be measured in pixels. 
A pixel is a small point on the display. 
How small? Most computer monitors have a resolution of 72 pixels per inch, so a pixel represents about 1/72nd of an inch. 
Pixels are sometimes also referred to as points. Pixels are used to set the exact size of an element, in this case, text.
p {
  font-size: 18px;
}

2. ems - Pronounced just as it looks, "em." An em is equal to the width of the letter "m". 
Ems are a relative unit of measurement. They change the size of text relative to the parent element's size of text.
p {
  font-size: 1.3em;
}

3. % - Percentages are also a relative unit of measurement. 
The default size of text in web browsers is 16 pixels, or 16px.
When percentages are used, they set the size of text relative to this default size. 
For example, setting the font size to 200% would be equivalent to setting it to 32px.
p {
  font-size: 150%;
}
