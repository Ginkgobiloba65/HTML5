the universal selector, *, is used to select every element on the page and set the font to Arial.
* {
  font-family: Arial;
}
In the example above is used to select every element on the page and set the font to Arial.




RGB colors, rgb() when styling a color.
h1 {
  color: rgb(123, 20, 233);
  background-color: rgb(99, 21, 127);
}

Hex Colors
h1 {
  color: #FFFFFF;
  color: #FFF; /* This is the same color as above */
}
When a hex color code is composed of entirely of the same characters, the hex color can be abbreviated, like so:
h2 {
  color: #AA33BB;
  color: #A3B; /* This is the same color as above */
}


Indentation & Spacing
Just like HTML, CSS follows certain best practices for spacing and indentation.
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
One space should be used between the selector and the opening curly brace ({).
No extra spaces should exist between opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) and CSS declarations (as in the example above).
Two spaces of indentation should be used for CSS declarations.
One line of spacing should exist between CSS rules. In the example above, there is one line of spacing between the CSS rule for the heading and the CSS rule for the paragraph.
