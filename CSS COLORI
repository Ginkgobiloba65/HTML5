COLORI:

h1 {
  color: rgb(22, 34, 88);
  color: rgba(22, 34, 88, 0.4);
}
RGB colors, rgb() when styling a color.
h1 {
  color: rgb(123, 20, 233);
  background-color: rgb(99, 21, 127);
}
RGB colors support OPACITY (hex color codes do not)
The extra a character in the rgba() value is known as the alpha value. 
It represents the opacity of a color. The alpha value can be a number between 0 or 1, inclusive.
h1 {
  color: rgba(123, 88, 9, 0.5);
}
In the example above, the alpha value has been set to 0.5. 
This indicates that the color of the heading will be set to 50% of its normal opacity.


Hex Colors
h1 {
  color: #FFFFFF;
  color: #FFF; /* This is the same color as above */
}
When a hex color code is composed of entirely of the same characters, the hex color can be abbreviated, like so:
h2 {
  color: #AA33BB;
  color: #A3B; /* This is the same color as above */
}


HSL (is a part of CSS3, older browsers may not support it)
HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Lightness. Specifically, this is what each means:

Hue - the technical term that describes what we understand as "color." 
In HSL, hue is represented on a color wheel. 
It can take on values between 0 and 360.

Saturation - the amount of gray in a given color. 
In HSL, saturation is specified using a percentage between 0% and 100%. 
The percentage 0% represents a shade of gray, whereas 100% represents full saturation.

Lightness - the amount of white in a given color. 
Similar to saturation, lightness is specified using a percentage between 0% and 100%. 
The percentage 0% represents black, whereas 100% represents white. 
50% is normal.

You can use HSL colors in your CSS like this:
h1 {
  color: hsl(182, 20%, 50%);
}
The alpha value can also be used for HSL colors, using hsla():
h1 {
  color: hsla(239, 45%, 22%, 0.4);
}


Specifically, we can add multiple CSS color declarations, just in case a user's browser can't support a certain declaration.
h1 {
  color: rgb(22, 34, 88);
  color: rgba(22, 34, 88, 0.4);
}
In CSS, the latter of multiple declarations takes priority. 
In the example above, if the user's browser supports rgba(), then that color will be applied to the heading. 
If it does not, then CSS will use the first rgb() color declaration, as a backup.
